Week 1: I did not utlize AI this week, Though I did search up on the web some techniques and examples utlized in my code. 
Week 2: This week, I utlized AI to aid me in some of the pratice exercises. Instaed of just copy and pasting the answer into chatgpt, 
I decided to build off of my own code and the intsructions given to me. I still worked the process out myslef, but when I got stuck I would ask chat gpt
Week 3: This week, I utilized AI to help break down some of the taks given to me in thos weeks assignment. I was a littlt confused on instructions at times 
and I thought my best bet besides the TA, was to as for help from AI
Week 4:  This week, I utilized AI to help break down some of the taks given to me in thos weeks assignments again, I also used it to fix some of the ouput code. 

Week 5: This week I utilized AI alot more than I have the previous weeks. Encapsulation was a pretty hard concept for me to grasp and I need to do some more pratice. Chatgpt 
aided me a lot with this weeks problems. I started to understand towards the end but I defneitly need to do more studying. 

Week 6: This week proved to be more of a challenge for me . I defnitley used AI a lot more to help breakdown some of the problems and spent a lt more time on my code. 

Week 7: This weeks code was by far the most challenging out of all of the past assignments. I found myself heavily relying on chatgpt to aid me in getting most of my code completed. At times, 
I made silly mistakes a found myself getting fusrated easily. I defnitly need to study and brush up on these topics. 

Week 7: This weeks code was  challenging as well. I found myself relying on chatgpt to aid me just a little less but I think I was also overthinging things . 

Week 9: This weeks code was not that bad. I think after doing a couple more challenging questions and watching videos I am caught back up
