Week 1: I did not utlize AI this week, Though I did search up on the web some techniques and examples utlized in my code. 
Week 2: This week, I utlized AI to aid me in some of the pratice exercises. Instaed of just copy and pasting the answer into chatgpt, 
I decided to build off of my own code and the intsructions given to me. I still worked the process out myslef, but when I got stuck I would ask chat gpt
Week 3: This week, I utilized AI to help break down some of the taks given to me in thos weeks assignment. I was a littlt confused on instructions at times
